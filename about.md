# Me

My name is **Hamish MacDonald** and I am a cloud data engineer.  Based in Brisbane, I am senior data engineer at [**Entain**].

My background has been in the financial services domain and I have previously worked at AMP, Schroders, BOQ and QSuper.  My passion for data and analytics has evolved throughout all of those jobs as I have gone up the learning curve.  My core experience and skills are in data warehousing.  However as I have read, coded, failed and coded some more, my interests have my closer and closer to the machine.

My favourite languages are C and Rust and my favourite domain is socket programming and language servers.

I have recently been inspired by reading Andrew Kelley's blog, about his programming experiences and his path to creating, Zig.

This blog is just a way from me to record my trials and tribulations and I attempt to leverage my C knowledge and learn Zig.`

On a personal front, I am married to Becky and have 2 kids, Jack and Sophie.
