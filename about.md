# Me

My name is **Hamish MacDonald** and I am a cloud data engineer.  Based in Brisbane, I work as a consultant for <https://www/Servian.com>.  **Servian** has a vision of being Australia's number one data firm and is a fantastic place to work.

My background has been in the financial services domain and I have previously worked at AMP, Schroders, BOQ and QSuper.  My passion for data and analytics has evolved throughout all of those jobs as I have gone up the learning curve.  My core experience and skills are in data warehousing.  I am also a passionate Python and Scala programmer and try to contribute to open source projects for both languages in my spare time.

I would like to become an expert at engineering machine learning applications.  Producing, enhancing and maintaing production-level machine learning applications is a niche skill with many technologies to master and a fast pace of development and change.  I feel very fortunate to be able to work in this domain at this time in history.

On a personal front, I am married to Becky and have 2 kids, Jack and Sophie.
